                    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                    <p>This seminar topic is on the development of <strong><em>Agent Based System and Application</em></strong>, a system which is broadly used in any process of making a device that is intelligent and its applications are vastly felt among the society in entertainment, education, sports, social stimulation management and a whole lot more. Since the constraint is time factor, I will not be able to implement it. With the limited time given I bring to light the definition, characteristics, differences between agents and regular (non-agent) software, advantages and disadvantages of an agent based system and application of some application domains where agent technologies will play a crutial role.</p>

                    <h3 id="section-introduction">1.0   INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Agent is taken from the Latin word "agree" which means to do. In a layman's understanding, agent can be seen as a person or thing that does or act on behalf of another. While in computer science and industry, they basically have almost the same definition about agent in the real world but computer science refers it as a software entity while real world or layman sees it as a person, instrument, something or any other objects.</p>
                    <p>Agent based system and application is a program of software that monitors all the activities that oes on among an environment with the help of its intelligence. It mainly controls all the activities and also makes work easier for the computer user or owners. The programmer will program it in such a way it will work accordin to the instruction given to it by the user or owner.</p>
                    <p>These applications give an account about everything that happens around the environment where the computer system that carries the application is in the absent of the owner, computer set or operator.</p>
                    <p>The concept of agency is now being broadly usedf not only as a model for computer programming units displaying a certain kind of characteristics but also in a more abstract and general way as a new metaphor for the analysis specification and implementation of complex software systems.</p>
                    <h4>1.1 History of Agent Based System and Application</h4>
                    <p>Agent based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940's but because it requires computational intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until in the year 1990's which people knew the value of computer and how to operate it well.</p>
                    <p>Bonabeau (2002) presents a good survey of the potentials of agent based modeling as of the time that its modeling software became widely available</p>

                    <h3 id="section-literature review">2.0  LITERATURE REVIEW</h3>
                    <p>After researching about the agent based system and application, so many founders of books defined it in different ways both in the meanimng</p>
                    <p>David and Alan (2010), defined agent based system and application as software that acts in an environment with a body, receives information through their sensors, and act in the world through their actuators or also called effectors.</p>
                    <P>According to Wooldridge and Jennings (1995), they defined agent based system and application as a computer system that is situated in some environment that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives.</P>
                    <p>Agent based system and application refers to a software component that acts on our behalf without authority, and that is intended to do so in our best interest (Swedish Institute of Computer Science 1999-2000)</p>
                    <P>The contribution of McCarthy (1990) and was rewritten in 2007 goes with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, so therefore agent based system and application is the center in Artificial Intelligence that always try to make things which is intelligent. This thing is not necessarily a machine and it can be considered as agent. Therefore we can conclude that agaent based system and application is the ultimate objective of Artificial Intelligence.</P>
                    <P>Russell and Nerving (2003) contributed in the definition of agent based system and application; they said that agent based sytem and application is a software that will act on behalf of other parties (computer users). This software that is acting on behalf of the computer user needs to be intelligent enough. In this definition, they concluded that agent based system and application is an intelligent software agent.</P>
                    <P>Franklin and Graesser (1996) defined agent based system and application as a software that is capable to receive command from computer users (i.e human who want to finish some task), and can act intelligently to do those tasks which has been delegated by computer users. During the activities, an agent basically can interact with the environment to do its task without much interaction and command from computer users.</P>
                    <h4>2.1 AGENTS AND REGULAR (NON-AGENTS) SOFTWARE</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Autonomy:</b> Agents should be able to perform the majority of their problem solving tasks without the direct intervention of a human or agents and they should have a degree of control over their own actions and their own intenal state.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Social Ability:</b> Agents should be able to interact when they deem appropriate with other software agents and humans in other to complete their own problem solving and to help others with their activities where appropriate.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Responsiveness:</b> Agents should persive their environment (which may be the physical world, a user, a collection of agents, the internet etc) and response in a timely fashion to change which occur on it.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Proactiveness:</b> Agents should not simply act in response to their environment, they should be able to exhibit appropriate goal directed behaviour and take the initiative where appropriate.</li><br>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>2.2 ADVANTAGES OF AGENT BASED SYSTEM AND APPLICATION</h4>
                    <p><b>2.2.1 New Real Time Continuously Monitoring:</b> The end point agent resident in a computer asset can monitor, secure configuration parameters continuously or periodically and report compliance to the repository sub-system (database).</p>
                    <p><b>2.2.2 Complex Management Tasking:</b> The agent is a mission application; it may be programmed to perform complex management tasks such as checking the host platform on ti security configuration parameters and enforcing the installation of security patches.</p>
                    <p><b>2.2.3 Deep Visibility to Security Configuration:</b> Because the agent resides locally on computing assist and is executed as a system process, it usually has direction access to the security kernel; it has visibility to priviledge system configuration files.</p>
                    <h4>2.3 DISADVANTAGES OF AGENT BASED SYSTEM AND APPLICATION</h4>
                    <p>Agent based system and application has some challenges that have hindered people from using it, they are;</p>
                    <p><b>2.3.1 Higher Operation Costs:</b> End point agents are required to be installed on target computer assets. For a large enterprise, this entails greater operation costs installation and maintenance (i.e patch upgrade).</p>
                    <p><b>2.3.2 Incompatibility Between Agents:</b> An end point agent is a mission specific application that runs on top of an operation (0/5). A host may run multiple agents, such as one for antivirus systems, one for instruction detection (check point zone alarm), and another one for configuration management (Tivolic configuration manager). Introduction of an endpoint agent may disrupt or interfere with existing agents.</p>
                    <P><B>2.3.3 Endpoint Agents Require Configuration Management:</B> The agent is a software and so it may require a software distribution services to manage configurations. Therefore the repository sub system (database) requires an agent distribution program to track and maintain agent configuration throughout an enterprise.</P>
                    <p><b>2.3.4 Not All Application Domains are Appropriate for Agent:</b> Application domains which are represented by application domain object provides isolation, uploading and security boundaries. this can be barriers for agents.</p>
                    <h4>2.4 SOME APPLICATION DOMAINS WHERE AGENT TECHNOLOGIES WILL PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE</h4>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><b>Ambient Intelligence:</b> The seamless deliveries of ubiquitous computing, continuous communication and intelligent user interfaces to consumer and industrial devices.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Electronic Business:</b> Where agent based approaches are already supporting the automation and semi-automation of information gathering activities and purchase transaction over the internet.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Semantic Web:</b> Where agents are neede both to provide services and to make best use of the resources available, often in co-operation with others.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Bio Information and Computational Biology:</b> Where intelligent agents may support the coherent exploration of data revolution occuring in biology.</li><br>

                    <h3 id="section-explanation of agent based system and application">3.0  EXPLANATION OF AGENT BASED SYSTEM AND APPLICATION</h3>
                    <p>Early, Artificial Intelligence (A.I) papers predicted the development of complete system that would exhibit most of the characteristics that will associate with intelligence in human behaviour. Such system will perceive the environment through artificial eyes and ears and would communicate in natural languages, reason is to solve problem and formulate plans that will also act on the formula to archieve their goals and would learn from their experience. Artificial intelligent researchers have seen that it is difficult to develop, then use the features or study the function of an intelligent system, then brought to a conclusion that artificial intelligent building system exhibits several cognitive functions associated with human intelligence is now feasible and such system are called Agent Based System (ABS).</p>
                    <p>Many artificial intelligent researchers like Russell and Nerving (2013); Wooldridge and Jennings (1995); Smith et al (1994); Franklin and Graesser (1996), brought to general characterization of an agent based system and application. They defined it as a knowledge based system that perceives its environment (which may be the physical world, a user via a graphical user interface, a collection of other agents, the internet or other complex environment), reasons to interpret perceptions, draw inference, solve problems and determine actions and upon that environment to realize a set of goals or tasks for which it was designed.</p>
                    <p>It can accept high level requests indicating what the user want and can decide how to satisfy each request with some degree of independence or autonomy exhibiting goal, with directed behaviour, dynamically choosing which to take, and in what sequence it can collaborate with its users to improve the accomplishment of the tasks or can carry out such tasks on users behalf. In so doing, it can employ some knowledge or representation of the user, advise the users on how to perform a task, train the user or can also help different users to collaborate. The behaviour of the agent is based on a correspondence between the external application domain such as object and classes of objects, laws and actions. The interference engine consist of the programs that manipulate the data structure in the knowledge base in order to solve the problems for which the agents were designed.</p>
